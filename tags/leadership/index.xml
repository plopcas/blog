&lt;p&gt;Having a job pays the bills, but if that is all it means to you, it will be hard to get inspired. It is reasonable to expect a job to excite you and provide you with a higher sense of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purpose is feeling that your time is being well spent and that you work is adding value to something that matters. For some people is easier to feel purpose, and some vocations are also simply more likely to help you feel purpose e.g. teachers and healthcare professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most people are not wired to feel purpose and most jobs and not clearly fulfilling in that sense. You, as a manager, have to effectively lead all those people. What can you do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most people it is hard to objectively self-evaluate their work and behaviours. Great leaders learn to build strong self-awareness. There are two main sources of information that can help you with this.&lt;/p&gt;
