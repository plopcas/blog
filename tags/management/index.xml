      <description>As a manager I like to follow what I call &amp;ldquo;my 7 principles of management&amp;rdquo; when I work with my team. Sometimes we find ourselves overwhelmed and under pressure. Having a set of clear principles that are easy to remember can help us go back in track quickly and easily. Mine are based on my own experience and have helped me in the past in numerous occasions. These are:
 A manager must be supportive and work for the team A manager must be flexible and adapt to the situation at hand A manager must be aware and connected A manager must challenge the team in constructive and engaging ways A manager must be trustworthy and lead by example A manager must be caring and empathic A manager must be transparent and operate with candour  From these principles you can probably see what management style looks like.</description>
