Following up from the last article about managing low performers, this time I will talk about the other side of the coin, high performers? But first, we need to understand what a high performer is.

<!--more-->

* They maintain a **positive attitude** at all times, focused on what they can do. They believe that through hard work and persistence they can achieve anything. Therefore, they have a strong **long-term focus** and **self-discipline**.

* They are **inspiring** to others, and display **natural leadership** qualities. Other people will rally around them.

* They care about **growth**, always eager to **learn** new skills and sharpen existing ones. They learn from mistakes too. As a result, they usually find innovative solutions to challenging problems, and are flexible and adaptable.

* They are **problem solvers**, and **get things done**. It's almost as if they lived to accomplish the most challenging tasks.

* They are **self-driven**. With little or no external motivation they can and will deliver.

Below you can find some tips to manage those of your employees that fit into this category.

#### Be ready to give constructive feedback, regularly

Use your 1–1’s to maximum impact

#### Help them learn, inside and outside the organisation

#### Agree on clear goals and align expectations

#### Give them the tools they need

#### Get out of their way

Give them flexibility in ‘how’ they work.
Encourage them to decompress. Working unusually long hours, repeatedly skipping meals or exercise, sacrificing their own well-being might enable them to meet short term deadlines, but it will be detrimental to their productivity and performance in the long run. Those who manage high performers need to recognise this challenge. Gently remind them to pace themselves and think about their contributions on a larger scale. They cannot work at an optimal level if they're perpetually burned out or run down.

#### Keep It Interesting

Make Sure They are Being Challenged.

#### Provide opportunities for growth

Give them visibility
Provide them with mentors

#### Surround them with other top players

#### Design a career path for them

Make them responsible--and then reward them
greater involvement in planning/decision making
exposure at a more senior or challenging level

#### Create a safe environment that embraces failure

Ironically, the more that others celebrate a high achiever's successes, the more afraid he or she can become of making mistakes. This causes them to shy away from risky endeavors and new challenges, locking them into familiar routines and causing their career trajectory to level off, while their peers continue to rise.

This doesn't mean that you should stop rewarding success, but you should help high achievers overcome any fear of failure.

#### Remember your other employees

High performers can positively motivate others on your team but they can do quite the opposite as well. A good leader must defend the team, even if it means cutting a high performer.

Have in mind that high performers are usually perfectionists and quite independent, which means they could run out of patience if paired with other employees.

Also, sometimes they might think that results justify binding the rules a little, and this can cause friction and more issues. In some ways, it's understandable that their manager overlooks some of those shortcuts as long as they keep turning in record-breaking achievements, but it doesn't help them to be perceived as team players.

As a manager, help them understand that by embracing the protocol, they can send the message that they don't see themselves as exempt and privileged, and that ultimately, we are all on the same team.

#### Accept that sooner or later they might move on
