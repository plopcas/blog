Having a job pays the bills, but if that is all it means to you, it will be hard to get inspired. It is reasonable to expect a job to excite you and provide you with a higher sense of purpose.

Purpose is feeling that your time is being well spent and that you work is adding value to something that matters. For some people is easier to feel purpose, and some vocations are also simply more likely to help you feel purpose e.g. teachers and healthcare professionals.

But most people are not wired to feel purpose and most jobs and not clearly fulfilling in that sense. You, as a manager, have to effectively lead all those people. What can you do?

You can create a sense of purpose. In order to do that:

- First you will need to articulate the important goals they are serving beyond their daily work. This could be related to the wellbeing of the community, or education, or environmental goals. It is too easy to get lost in the routine and lose sight of the bigger picture your organisation serves. As a manager, your duty is to remind them.

- Next, you must find ways to link your employees to the outcomes of their work, e.g. if they create applications for young doctors, show them feedback from the real users, or even better, invite some users to the office so that they can share their experience first hand. Anything that can help them feel the value they are adding is worth trying.

- Finally, do not forget to give you team voice and autonomy. That is input in the decision making process and freedom to be creative and not micromanaged. This will have the side benefit of improving trust and create opportunities for development.

For some jobs it might be easier, but for any job, with a little effort, you can help people get over their routine and feel genuine purpose.
