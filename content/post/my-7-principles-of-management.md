# My 7 Principles of Management
As a manager I like to follow what I call "my 7 principles of management" when I work with my team. These are:

1. A manager must be supportive and work for the team
2. A manager must be flexible and adapt to the situation at hand
3. A manager must be aware and connected
4. A manager must challenge the team in constructive and engaging ways
5. A manager must be trustworthy and lead by example
6. A manager must be caring and empathic
7. A manager must be transparent and operate with candour

From these principles you can probably see what management style looks like. I will explore each of the principles in more detail below.
